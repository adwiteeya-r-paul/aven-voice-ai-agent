## Aven Voice AI Agent

I built this project during my fellowship at HeadStarter BuildCore Beta. As a young developer, I got to attempt a full stack project for the first time through this opportunity. While the voice agent has many bugs right now, it helped me learn the basics of Frontend and in less than a week helped me finish my personal project "Top News Visualizer" - that I built for Google Maps Platform Awards.

## How it is built

The agent provides customer support for a startup named Aven. It is built using Pinecone, Groq, Huggingface and Vapi, and rendered on Vercel.

## Known bugs

 Currently the chatbot does not process more than one request, and fails to respond if the answer cannot be found from the knowledge base.
