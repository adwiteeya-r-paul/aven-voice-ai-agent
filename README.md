## Aven Voice AI Agent

I built this project during my fellowship at HeadStarter BuildCore Beta for the startup named Aven. As a young developer, I got to attempt a full stack project for the first time for a live startup project. While the voice agent has many bugs right now, I self-taught the basics of frontend while working on it, and within a week, the skills I learnt helped me finish my personal project "Top News Visualizer" that I built for Google Maps Platform Awards.

## How it is built

The agent provides customer support for a startup named Aven. It is built using Pinecone, Groq, Huggingface and Vapi, and rendered on Vercel.

## Known bugs

 Currently the chatbot does not process more than one request, and fails to respond if the answer cannot be found from the knowledge base.
